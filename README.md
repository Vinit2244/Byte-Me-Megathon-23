Welcome to Megathon - the ultimate hackathon organized by IIITH! In this hackathon, our team, **Byte Me** - consisting of Vinit Mehta, Medha Prasad, Vyakhya Gupta, and Pearl Shah, took on the challenge of creating a medical chatbot to assist doctors in suggesting treatments. We leveraged Hugging Face's Language Model (LLM) and utilized a specially provided dataset by the organizing company.
